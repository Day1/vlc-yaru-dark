# VLC Yaru Dark

A VLC media player Skin for Ubuntu 20.04 with [Yaru theme](https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru). The skin is based on [GNOME-style client-side decorations (CSD) initiative](https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/CSD).

Most of the icons are reused from [VLC-Arc-Dark](https://github.com/varlesh/VLC-Arc-Dark)

The skin was tested on : 
* VLC 3.0.8
* Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 Beta

* Open VLC and go to preference > Interface > Choose Skin. Select YaruDark.vlt
* Restart VLC.

## Approach of the project and next steps:
I Involve [/r/Ubuntu](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/) reddit community at each step of the design.

Based on my post of [April 10th](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/fyk9uj/my_vlc_yaru_dark_skin_is_ready_to_download_link/), here are the main features I will try to adf for the next release:
* Make the skin resizable (with a maximize button)
* Add a Volume button
* Add more function on the fullscreen
* Package the skin in .deb to push the update more easily
