# VLC Yaru Dark

A VLC media player Skin for Ubuntu 20.04 with [Yaru theme](https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru). The skin is based on [GNOME-style client-side decorations (CSD) initiative](https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/CSD).

There are 3 differents variant of the skin:

* **VLC Yaru Dark (Official)**
* *VLC Yaru Dark with the maximise button - Ubuntu 18.04 style (experimental)*
* *VLC Yaru Dark with the maximise button - Ubuntu 20.04 style (experimental)*

The skin was tested on : 

* VLC 3.0.8
* Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04
* resolution of 1920 X 1080


## Install
* Download the file [YaruDark.vlt](https://gitlab.com/NovaQC/vlc-yaru-dark/-/raw/master/YaruDark.vlt?inline=false)
* Open VLC and go to preference > Interface > Choose Skin. Select YaruDark.vlt
* Restart VLC.

## Approach of the project and next steps:
I Involve [/r/Ubuntu](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/) reddit community at each step of the design.

Based on my post of [April 10th](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/fyk9uj/my_vlc_yaru_dark_skin_is_ready_to_download_link/), here are the main features I will try to add for the next release:

- [x] Make the skin resizable (with a maximize button);
- [x] Add Volume button and slider;
- [x] Add more function on the fullscreen;
- [ ] Package the skin in .deb to push the update more easily.
